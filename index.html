    <p id="first-post">I figured out that I could use Github to make my first site. Now, I can use all my knowledge of CSS and HTML to make this blog. Conversely, I might just take a break now.
      I am currently coding this blog using HTML and CSS. It is fun! I had no idea how this worked until just now. I have used Khan Academy to teach myself how to code. Did you know, that before today, I did not know at all about coding a website on a host like Github.</p>

    <p id="second-post">I am back from camping for 1 day + 1 night in Blair Valley in the Anza-Borrego desert. It was really fun because me and my brother went on a lot of hikes, finding lots of cacti and plants in general along the way.
      I also was reading some books while camping, and am glad that I can learn more about how to code on Khan Academy and am able to apply my newfound knowledge to this website.</p>
