    <h2>First post</h2>
    <h6 class="date">Posted on 11/22/2023 (11AM) (M/D/Y)</h6>
    <p class="content">I figured out that I could use Github to make my first site. Now, I can use all my knowledge of CSS and HTML to make this blog. Conversely, I might just take a break now.
      I am currently coding this blog using HTML and CSS. It is fun! I had no idea how this worked until just now. I have used Khan Academy to teach myself how to code. Did you know, that before today, I did not know at all about coding a website on a host like Github.</p>

    <h2>Second Post</h2>
    <h6 class="date">Posted on 11/26/2023 (6PM) (M/D/Y)</h6>
    <p class="content">I am back from camping for 1 day + 1 night in Blair Valley in the Anza-Borrego desert. It was really fun because me and my brother went on a lot of hikes, finding lots of cacti and plants in general along the way.
      I also was reading some books while camping, and am glad that I can learn more about how to code on Khan Academy and am able to apply my newfound knowledge to this website.</p>

    <h2>Third Post</h2>
    <h6 class="date">Posted on 11/27/2023 (3PM) (M/D/Y)</h6>
    <p class="content">I have just came out of school, and am coding this as I am waiting for my dad to pick me up from school. My school day was pretty good, as I had a B day, which means that I had a funner assortment of classes today, rather than an A day.These include but are not limited to Art, Math, Science, PE, and finally, English.</p>

  <div id="fourthpost">
    <h2>Fourth Post</h2>
    <h6 class="date">Posted on 11/28/2023 (8PM) (M/D/Y)</h6>
    <p class="content">I've been trying to train for my school soccer tryouts. One of the things they'll put into account in whether or not they should put you in the team is your time on a 2 mile run. So, I've been training on improving my time for 2 miles. I just went on a run and my average time per mile was 10:27. (10 minutes 27 seconds) I have been improving though, as my first average mile time was 10:47.</p>
